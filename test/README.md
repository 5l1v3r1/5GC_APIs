Potential issue in Swagger Editor 3.6.24 (was working fine in previous versions).

To reproduce:
* Load the "test.yaml" file in Swagger Editor by following the "Test" link below
* In the right panel, expand the POST method
* You get an error from the resolver, saying that type B2 (in file b.yaml) cannot be found
